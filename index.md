Hi, my name is Juyoung Wang, and I am currently having a great fortune to study towards my Master of Applied of Science degree having [Merve Bodur](https://sites.google.com/site/mervebodr/) and [Mucahit Cevik](https://people.ryerson.ca/mcevik/) as advisors. Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in some region inside the convex hull generated by {Optimization, Statistics, Mathematics}.
