Hi, my name is Juyoung Wang, and I am currently having a great fortune to study towards my Master of Applied of Science degree having [Merve Bodur](https://sites.google.com/site/mervebodr/) and [Mucahit Cevik](https://people.ryerson.ca/mcevik/) as advisors. 

Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in the intersection of Optimization, Statistics (particular emphasis to statistical learning) and Mathematics.

My email address is juyoung [DoT] wang [AT] mail [dOT] utoronto [Dot] ca.

Please feel free to speak me in either English, Spanish and Korean. I grew up in both South Korea and Chile.
